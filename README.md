# First‑Home‑ZIP‑Scout

**Find the best U.S. ZIP codes for first‑time home buyers.**  
This project digests Redfin’s ZIP‑level market‑tracker data (2013 Q3 → present), cleans and enriches it, explores price & supply dynamics, engineers risk and growth features, segments local markets, and (in the next notebook) builds a model to rank each ZIP on first‑time‑buyer friendliness.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/First‑Home‑ZIP‑Scout.git
cd First‑Home‑ZIP‑Scout

# Set up environment
conda env create -f environment.yml     # or: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch notebook interface
jupyter lab
Notebook Pipeline
Run 01_data_cleaning.ipynb to produce cleaned_dataset.csv.

Run 02_exploratory_analysis.ipynb for charts and maps.

Run 03_feature_engineering.ipynb to add volatility, growth, cluster labels.

Run 04_modeling.ipynb to train the ranking model and export recommendations.

🛠️ Engineered Features
Feature	Description
affordability_score	Median sale price ÷ median price / sq ft (≈ space per $)
turnover_ratio	Homes sold ÷ inventory (market heat)
volatility_qoq	Standard deviation of quarterly price %‑change (risk)
pct_growth_5y	Five‑year price appreciation
pct_growth_10y	Ten‑year price appreciation
cluster	K‑means segment (e.g. balanced, hot micro‑market, deep‑inventory metro)

🗺️ Roadmap
Target definition: Composite first‑time‑buyer score balancing price, supply, competition, and growth.

Model comparison: Gradient Boosting vs. k‑NN recommender with SHAP explainability.

Streamlit dashboard: Interactive map with filters (budget, state, cluster).

Quarterly refresh: GitHub Action to pull new Redfin data and rebuild rankings.
